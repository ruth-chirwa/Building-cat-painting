  /*CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned
   in the browser. It has a position property you can set to static, 
  absolute, relative, sticky or fixed.*/
  /*Once you set the position property of the element, 
  you can move the element around by setting a pixel or a percentage value 
  for one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.*/
  /*static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element,
   you won't be able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom.*/
   /*sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It allows an element to stick to a specific position 
   within its containing element or viewport, based on the scroll position.*/
